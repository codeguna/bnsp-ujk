## Usage

This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit database credentials there
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate`
